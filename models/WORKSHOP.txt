If you're willing to add valvebiped playermodels you must put them in a folder named 'player' in the models folder.
If you're willing to add ported legacy/goldsrc playermodels you must put them in a folder named 'goldsrc' and 'player' in the models folder.
Ill of the models in those folders can be accessed with cl_playermodel in the developer console.

If animations aren't working, you can try adding these to the QC file:

// if the model is male then use the one below this line

$includemodel m_anm.mdl

// if the model is female then use the one below this line

$includemodel f_anm.mdl

// if the model is a zombie then use the one below this line

$includemodel z_anm.mdl
