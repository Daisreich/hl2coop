# Half-Life 2 Cooperative

## Not to be confused with Synergy.

This mod is a freeware, simple, and more optimized experience. It is designed to be a lightweight, more easier experience of a cooperative multiplayer mod that uses the singleplayer episodic code and MP engine.
It was going to be released on steam as a private, standalone game but i've scrapped that idea entirely.
